# Write a comprehension whose values is the first 10 powers of 2
def bin_power:
    # write code here #
    return

# Write a list comprehension whose value is the cartesian product
# of two lists A , B.
# Example: A = [1,2,3], B = [4,5,6]:
#       A*B = [ (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)
def cartesian_product(A, B):
    # write code here #
    return

# Write a function which takes two lists A,B and creates using comprehension
# a dictionary whose keys is the items of list A and whose values
# are the items of list B. ( Implement zip built-in function )
# Example: A = ['A','B','C'], B = [ 5.0, 7.5, 3.14 ]
#       returns: { 'A':5.0, 'B':7.5, 'C':3.14 }
def zip_lists(A, B):
    # write code here #
    return

# Write a comprehension whose values is the set consisting
# of the odd numbers up to 100
def odd_list:
    # write code here #
    return

# Write a function which takes a list of positive numbers and returns
# a list that consist of: twice of that number if that number is divisible by 3
#                          square of that number if that number is not.
# Example: A = [3, 2, 10,   7,  9, 5 ]
#     returns: [6, 4, 100, 49, 18, 10]
def filter_list(A):
    # write code here #
    return
